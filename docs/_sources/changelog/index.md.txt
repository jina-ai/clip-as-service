# Changelog

CLIP-as-service follows semantic versioning. However, before the project reach 1.0.0, any breaking change will only bump the minor version.  An automated release note is [generated on every release](https://github.com/jina-ai/clip-as-service/releases). The release note includes features, bugs, refactorings etc. 

This chapter only tracks the most important breaking changes and explain the rationale behind them.
